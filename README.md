# IDEA EDU Course ...

Implemented in the <b>Spring Security for Java Backend Developer</b> Track of hyperskill.org's JetBrain Academy.<br>
https://hyperskill.org/projects/180

Project goal (or rather my interpretation of it) is to implement a Spring boot recipe application with Spring Security
and persisting into an H2 database.

## Technology / External Libraries

- Java 19
- Spring Boot 3.0.0
- Spring Web using "classical" WebMvC @RestController-style
- Spring Data JPA and Validate
- H2 Database
- Spring security 6.0 (coming up in later stages)
- Lombok
- Spring Tests with MockMvC
- Gradle 7.6

## Program description

The application will represent a program, that receives recipes voa REST-endpoints and stores them in a database.
We create a multi-user web service with Spring Boot that allows storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting recipes.

Currently implemented endpoints:

> <b>POST /api/recipe/new (unauthenticated)</b>. -> post a recipe as Json to stores it server-side.
The request JSON looks as:<pre>
{
    "name": "apple pie",
    "description": "easy apple pie",
    "ingredients": ["100 g sugar", "200 g butter", "5 apples"],
    "directions": ["make dough", "put in oven", "bake at 200Â°"]
}</pre> It returns the id in the store as key-value object.

> <b>GET /api/recipe/{id} (unauthenticated)</b>. -> receives recipe with id, that was previously send via POST.

## Project completion

## Repository Contents

Sources for all project tasks (5 stages) with tests and configurations.

## Progress

20.12.22 Project started. Just setup of build and repo with gradle.

23.12.22 Stage 1 completed. Post and get endpoint /api/recipe/ with full test coverage. Setup of typical Rest-Service
package structure with mapping of Dto <-> entities

24.12.22 Stage 2 completed. Now recipes posted are added in a list strting with id=1. The get method needs a
path variable containing the id. 404 is returned if the requested element does not exist or 400 in case the path variable 
is not in integer format.
